[[What is Wi-Fi?]]
# Wi-Fi SSID Association
1. Client discovers WLAN
2. WLAN Beacon Frames indicate type of Authentication in use:
	1. Pre-Shared Key (deprecated)
	2. Open Authentication
3. Exchange of Authentication Request/Response frames
4. Exchange of Association Request/Response frames
5. Authentication/Encryption negotiations take place
# WLAN Authentication Overview
- Authentication can be accomplished with or without encryption
- Two ways of implementing authentication:
	- Authenticate the user
	- Authenticate the device
# Standalone Authentication
Methods without encryption:
	Pre-Shared Key (deprecated)
	Web Authentication (aka Captive Portal)
	802.1x
	MAC authentication
# Identifying Unsecured Wi-Fi Networks
- When a Wi-Fi network displays as "Secured" this means the AP has advertised a requirement to use encryption
- Unsecured Wi-Fi does not provide data confidentiality:
	- May or may not require authentication
	- Authentication typically provided via a Captive Portal
