[[Wi-Fi Security Authentication]]
Unsecured WLANs:
- Open
- No passwords
- Free to use
- Typically found in public places
Secured WLANs:
- May or may not advertise their presence
- Require some form of authentication
- Encrypt your data from Wi-Fi client to AP
- Obfuscate visibility of your data
# Perspective of Network Administrator
- Only allow authorized people onto the WLAN
- Only provide authorized resources via the WLAN
- Restrict the quantity of WLAN clients
- Detect rogue access points
# Perspective of Network User
- Keep Wi-Fi data save via encryption
# Three components of Security
- WLAN Security is composed of three pieces:
	- Authentication
	- Data confidentiality
	- Data integrity
- All of these are typically accomplished after you've already associated to your SSID
- Authentication can occur independently of encryption/integrity verification
- Encryption and data integrity go together
