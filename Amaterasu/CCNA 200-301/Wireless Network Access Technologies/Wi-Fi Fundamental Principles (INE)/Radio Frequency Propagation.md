[[What is frequency?]]
# Absorption
* Some materials can absorb RF energy
# Reflection
* Some materials that reflect RF energy into a different direction or even back to the source.
* RF energy is not absorbed into the material at all.
# Refraction
* The bending of a wave as it passes through objects of different density (i.e. from air into glass)
# Diffraction & Scattering
* The bending and spreading around of an RF signal when it encounters an obstruction.
# Free Space Path Loss
* FSPL = the amount of RF energy lost as a signal travels through the air.
* Loss is relative to frequency and distance
# Multipath
* As an RF signal (wave) is transmitted away from a transmitter, it will expand and encounter multiple objects on its way to the receiver.
	* When an RF signal is reflected off an object, multiple wavefronts are created.
* Effects of multipart
	* Data corruption
	* Signal nulling
	* Increased signal amplitude
	* Decreased signal amplitude
* Utilizing multiple antennas on the receiver can reduce the negative effects of multipath
