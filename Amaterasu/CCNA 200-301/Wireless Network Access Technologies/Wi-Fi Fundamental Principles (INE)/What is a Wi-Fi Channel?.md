		* 2.423 GHz
	* All of these frequencies can be modulated differently to encode data
# Wi-Fi channel bandwidth
Unlicensed Wi-Fi operates within the FCC ISM bands
Within each band a single Wi-Fi channel can consume:
+ 20 MHz of band width (802.11b)
+ 40 MHz of band width (802.11n)
+ 80 MHz of band width (802.11ac)
+ 160 MHz of band width (802.11ax)
