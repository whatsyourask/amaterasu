[[What is frequency?]]
# Frequency
* The greater the frequency, the more data that can be encoded onto a Wi-Fi.
# Wavelength
* Measured in meters
* Wavelength is related to frequency
* inversely proportional to frequency
	* The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength
	* The longer the wavelength, the better a signal propagates through things
# Amplitude
* The strength of the signal, a measurement of power.
* Amplitude can be modulated to encode data.
* RF amplitude weakens greatly over distance and as it passes through objects.
* This is called Attenuation
# Phase
* A comparison of the waveform between two RF signals.
* The phase of 2 RF waveforms can be intentionally modified to encode data
